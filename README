Subbed

This C# solution contains a library project ("Core") which can be used to manipulate subtitle files.
It also contains a CLI project ("CLI", imaginative huh) which I plan to keep in sync with the functionality of Core.

I started this project because too many a times I noticed a sub is out of sync, and I just need a little tool to fix it.

The format I use most is SubRip, but feel free to add others, as I will do too.

Example user story:
As a movie watcher
When I see my subtitle is getting more and more out of sync
I want to be able to pick a sentence, delay it by 2 seconds, and let the program calculate the remaining subtitle timings
So that I can enjoy my movie

Howto:
DvdV.Subbed.CLI.exe subtitleFile.srt --extrapolate "Beginning of sentence I want delayed"+2
